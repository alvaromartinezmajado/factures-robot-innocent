### Adding a Custom Field

To add a new custom field click on the settings icon  in the menubar and
then choose `Custom Fields`. On the overview click on `New` in the top right.

When adding custom fields, it is recommended to only use alpha and numeric characters for the label name. Once a
custom field has been added to an object, the custom field will display at the bottom of the form for that
object (so a custom field created for the client object will appear on the client form).

### Adding Custom Fields to Templates

Please take a look at the Customize Templates
page for more information about custom fields in templates.
