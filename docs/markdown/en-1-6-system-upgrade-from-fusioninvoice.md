Upgrade form FusionInvoice v1.x
-------------------------------

If you used FusionInvoice v.1x to manage your invoices you can migrate to InvoicePlane.  
Follow these steps to
migrate your installation.

### Make a full Backup

Actually you don't have to make a full backup of your FusionInvoice setup but we recommend to do so. We can not
guarantee that the Migrationtool is working without
problems.  
Make a complete copy of the folder that holds your installation and make a backup of your
database.

### Use the Migrationtool

1. Download the Migrationtool
   and unzip it to any directory on your webserver or your local machine and check if you copied the `.htaccess`
   file.
2. If you want to run the tool in a subdirectory please set the directory in the `config.php` file.
3. Then open the URL which can access the Migrationtool and follow the instructions.

Please do **not** use multiple directories like `yourdomain.com/tools/migration/migrationtool`
as the tool only supports one directory at the moment.
### Run the InvoicePlane Updates

After converting the database it's very important that you open the setup wizard
of your InvoicePlane installation located at `yourdomain.com/setup`. Follow the instructions and the
setup will run any necessary database updates. Without these updates InvoicePlane will not run.

If you encounter any problems please post a support request in the communtiy forums.
