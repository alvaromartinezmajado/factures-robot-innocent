Taxrates
--------

If you want to add taxes to products / items or invoices you have to configure them on the Taxrates settings page.

### Add a new Taxrate

To add a new taxrate, click the settings icon  near the right hand side of the main menu, select `Taxrates`, and click the `New` button near the top right of the page.

First enter the official name of the taxrate. Be careful as this will be displayed on quotes or invoices as a description of the taxrate. Then enter the percentage of the taxrate and click on `Save`.
