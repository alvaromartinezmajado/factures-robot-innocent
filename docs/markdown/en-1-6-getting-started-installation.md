Installation
------------

For those of you comfortable with installing web applications, installing InvoicePlane should take 5 minutes or
less.

1. Download and extract the archive.
2. Create an empty database on your web server.
3. Upload the files to your web server, either into a subdirectory or into the public root of the web server.
4. Make a copy of the `ipconfig.php.example` file and rename the copy to `ipconfig.php`
5. Open the `ipconfig.php` file and add your URL in it like described in the file.
6. Comment out the first line of the `ipconfig.php` file by adding a `#` at the beginning of the line as described at **pt. 2** here
7. Run the InvoicePlane installer from your web browser and follow his instructions: `http://your-domain.com/index.php/setup`

Once the installer finished, the installation is complete and you may log into InvoicePlane using the email
address and password you have chosen during the installation.

### Run InvoicePlane in a sub directory

If you want to run InvoicePlane in a sub directory (e.g. `http://yourdomain.com/invoices/`) you have
to modify the `.htaccess` file which is located in the root directory. You must add the line

```
RewriteBase /sub-directory
```

where `sub-directory` is the directory you want to use. The content of the file should look like this:

```
RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /sub-directory
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule . index.php [L]
```

After that, open your `ipconfig.php` file and add the sub directory to your URL like this:

```
http://your-domain.com/sub-directory
```

Notice that there is **no** trailing slash.

### Remove index.php from the URL

Please notice that this step is entirely optional and does not affect the application in any way.

1. Make sure that mod\_rewrite is enabled on your web
   server.
2. Open the file `ipconfig.php`
3. Search for `REMOVE_INDEXPHP=false` in this file and replace it with
   `REMOVE_INDEXPHP=true`
4. Rename the `htaccess` file to `.htaccess`
