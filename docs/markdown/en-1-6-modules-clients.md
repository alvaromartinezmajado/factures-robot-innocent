Clients

### View Clients

To view the client list, click `Clients` from the main menu and select `View Clients`.

By default, the client list will be filtered to active clients only. The filter can be set to either
`Active`, `Inactive` or `All` by choosing the filter from the submenu bar.  

To navigate between pages, use the pager buttons located on the submenu bar.

The `Options` button at the end of each row displays a menu with a number of items when clicked:

* `View` - View the client
* `Edit` - Edit the client
* `Create Quote` - Create a quote for the client
* `Create Invoice` - Create an invoice for the client
* `Delete` - Delete the client

### Add new Clients

To add a new client, either choose `Clients` from the main menu and select `Add Client`, or
from the client list, click the `New` button near the top right of the page.

When adding a new client, the only field required is the `Client Name` field, although if you plan to
email invoices and quotes to your clients, the `Email Address` field should be filled in as well. Any
custom fields created for client records will display at the bottom
of the client form.

### Client Logins

Clients can be granted permission to log into InvoicePlane to view their quotes and invoices, approve or reject
quotes and pay their invoices. See the `Guest Account` section of the User Accounts page for instructions on creating logins for
your clients.
